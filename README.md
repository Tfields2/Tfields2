# 👋 About Me

I’m a **Business Cybersecurity graduate from the University of Alabama** with a strong interest in **how security works in real systems, not just how it’s presented in classrooms or policies.**

I’m especially interested in **SOC analysis, incident response, networking, and digital forensics**, with hands-on experience in Linux and Windows environments, and I am actively expanding my knowledge in **network and cloud security**. I enjoy breaking systems, fixing them, and documenting *why* the fix works.

This portfolio highlights hands-on projects focused on **authentication, access control, logging, and incident handling**, built with a practical, defensive-security mindset.

If it’s terminal-based, security-focused, and forces me to think like an analyst I’m probably interested.
